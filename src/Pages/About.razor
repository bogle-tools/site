This site attempts to help you enact the <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments">Prioritizing Investments strategies from the Bogleheads Wiki<span class="oi oi-external-link m-2 aria-hidden="true"></span></a> <br/>

Privacy - None of the answers you fill out on this site get sent to my server. All calculations are done on your PC/Phone/Tablet.<br/>

Programmers - <a href='https://github.com/bogle-tools/site'>github.com/bogle-tools/site</a> is where the code is shared and issues are listed.<br/>

I plan to add tools to the pages to help you understand your progress and potential.<br/>
