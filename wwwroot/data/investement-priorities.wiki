Investors are faced with a variety of choices on ''where'' to invest their money (e.g., a [[taxable account]], a [[401(k)]], or an [[Traditional IRA |IRA]]). Knowing which accounts to invest in first will maximize return with a minimum of [[Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement|taxes]]. '''Prioritizing investments''' guides investors on the appropriate order of placing their investments into these accounts.

Investors should take care that any investment priority decision is aligned with their [[Investment policy statement| Investment Policy Statement]].

==Funding priority==

It is important to realize that these steps are not cast in stone. The above list should be considered with some flexibility for an investor's needs and personal preferences. 

===Choosing between an employer retirement plan and an IRA===
If the company plan offers good, low-cost funds, it may be preferable to contribute to the company plan ''before'' contributing to an IRA; see: [[IRA#Comparison to employer accounts|Comparison between IRAs and employer plans]].

Also, an investor's [[Marginal tax rate|marginal tax rate]] may influence the decision: those subject to higher marginal tax rates should consider higher contributions to a tax-deferred plan (e.g. traditional 401(k) or IRA) rather than a post-tax plan (e.g. Roth 401(k) or IRA); see [[Traditional versus Roth]] for more guidance.

If you prefer traditional to Roth, and traditional contributions to the employer's plan are needed to reduce your [[Modified_Adjusted_Gross_Income#MAGI_for_traditional_IRA_purposes|Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for traditional IRA purposes]] enough to allow a full or partial IRA deduction (see [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits IRA Deduction Limits]), consider swapping steps 5 and 6.

===Rationale for funding priority===
Table 1 describes the rationale for investing in the order previously described.

|-
|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"|
HSAs offer tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals when used for qualified medical expenses. You can view HSA contributions as being matched by the IRS.<ref name="grabiner"/> If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it won't be taxed at all as long as you spend it for medical care, so this is as good as $1000 in a Roth IRA.<ref name="grabiner"/> 

After age 65, the HSA can also be used for non-medical expenses, with such withdrawals taxed at your regular tax rate. So if you are unlucky and are too healthy after 65, the HSA is still as good as a pre-tax retirement account.<ref name="grabiner">{{Forum post|p=1962306 | title = Prioritizing investments- HSA goes where? | author = grabiner | date = February 16, 2014}}</ref> Unlike pre-tax retirement accounts, HSA contributions made through an employer are also [[payroll tax]]-deductible.

Use of an HSA requires participation in an IRS qualified [[High deductible health plan| high deductible health plan]] (HDHP) at work. Look at your particular health care needs to decide if you may be better off with a traditional health care plan or an HDHP plus HSA. If the latter, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.

|colspan = "3" style="text-align:left;"| Retirement accounts offer either an immediate tax deduction and tax-deferred growth (traditional) or life-long tax-free growth (Roth), plus [[asset protection]] and [[estate planning]] benefits.

Investors may have to choose among [[IRA#Comparison_to_employer_accounts|IRA vs. employer plan]] and/or [[traditional vs. Roth]] accounts and should consult those articles for more details.

Deductible IRA contributions are subject to income limits, but the income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA may be circumvented by the [[Backdoor Roth]] process. Employer plans may also offer [[mega-backdoor Roth]] contributions, but these should be made only after normal contributions.

==401(k) plans with high cost funds==
{{See also |401(k)#Expensive or mediocre choices|l1=401(k) § Expensive or mediocre choices}}

Many company plans contain high-cost funds which make them unattractive. If you have such a plan, look for one or two index funds or a bond fund that can be used. If your company offers matching funds up to a certain contribution level, it's '''always''' wise to use the company plan. If there is no match, the power of tax-deferred compounding and automatic contributions still favors using the plan with limited contributions.  

Also, if you leave your current employer you will most likely be able to rollover the assets in your poor-quality company plan to either a better company plan, or to an IRA.
