There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The index provider&#8217;s assessment of a company or of ESG criteria may differ from an investor&#8217;s assessment. As a result, bonds selected by the index provider for inclusion in the index may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The index provider is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data used to evaluate their ESG criteria. The ESG criteria assessed by the index provider may change over time. In addition, the fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in bonds of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector. The index provider may evaluate security-level ESG data and, if applicable, ESG criteria that are relevant to the index only at index reviews or rebalances. Securities included in the index may cease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the index and the fund until a future review or rebalance by the index provider.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>","plainTalk":"Many investors invest in bonds and bond funds in an attempt to lower the overall risk of their portfolios. This strategy makes sense when the bonds owned are hedged developed market bonds because their returns typically are not highly correlated with, and far less volatile than, stock returns. The strategy is less likely to be effective, however, when bonds owned are emerging market bonds. Returns of emerging market bonds, even dollar-denominated bonds like those owned by the fund, can be quite volatile, and tend to correlate more closely with U.S. and foreign stock returns than the returns of developed market bonds in general. Consequently, if your goal is to lower risk and volatility, this fund is not an appropriate investment.&#160; An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. Although Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF is listed for trading on the Nasdaq it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. Trading of Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF on the Nasdaq may be halted if Nasdaq officials deem such action appropriate, if Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF is delisted from the Nasdaq, or if the activation of marketwide &#8220;circuit breakers&#8221; halts stock trading generally. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<UL><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund based on expected sensitivity of the portfolio to interest rate movements.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund&#8217;s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the fund because it purchases investment-grade and below-investment-grade (also known as high-yield or junk) bonds.</LI><LI><strong>Emerging markets risk: </strong>The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in more developed foreign markets. Emerging markets risk should be high for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Country/regional risk: </strong>The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by foreign companies, governments, or government agencies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in a particular country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk for the fund is high.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a significant percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers.</LI><LI><strong>Index sampling risk: </strong>The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index.

The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<UL><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests in a diverse mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term bonds.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund&#8217;s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</LI><LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as <em>prepayment risk</em>. Call/prepayment risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a small portion of its assets in callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</LI><LI><strong>Country/regional risk: </strong>The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by foreign companies, governments, or government agencies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in a particular country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk for the fund is high.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a significant percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers.</LI><LI><strong>Currency hedging risk: </strong>The risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposures. The fund seeks to mimic the performance of foreign bonds without regard to currency exchange rate fluctuations. To accomplish this goal, the fund attempts to offset, or hedge, its foreign currency exposures by entering into currency hedging transactions. However, it generally is not possible to perfectly hedge the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposures. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened, or overhedges a currency that has strengthened, relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Currency hedging risk for the fund is low.</LI><LI><strong>Index sampling risk: </strong>The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (4 to 10 years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>","plainTalk":"An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, either directly or through its investments in the underlying funds, which could affect the Fund&#8217;s performance: Although Total World Bond ETF is listed for trading on the Nasdaq, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. Trading of Vanguard Total World Bond ETF and underlying funds&#8217; ETF shares on the Nasdaq may be halted if Nasdaq officials deem such action appropriate, or if Total World Bond ETF shares and underlying funds&#8217; ETF shares are delisted from the Nasdaq, or if the activation of market wide &#8220;circuit breakers&#8221; halts stock trading generally. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<UL><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be relatively low for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered to be of high quality.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</LI><LI><strong>Prepayment risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage&#8217;s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income.</LI><LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI><LI><strong>Country/Regional risk: </strong>The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by foreign companies, governments, or government agencies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in a particular country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/Regional risk for the fund is high.</LI><LI><strong>Currency hedging risk: </strong>The risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposures. The fund seeks to mimic the performance of foreign bonds without regard to currency exchange rate fluctuations. To accomplish this goal, the fund attempts to offset, or hedge, its foreign currency exposures by entering into currency hedging transactions. However, it generally is not possible to perfectly hedge the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposures. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened, or overhedges a currency that has strengthened, relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Currency hedging risk for the fund is low.</LI><LI><strong>Index sampling risk: </strong>The chance that the securities selected for a fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of a fund&#8217;s target index.</LI><LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of low or falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Extension risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of rising interest rate rates, certain debt obligations will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg Global Aggregate Float Adjusted Composite Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index","betaPrimary":"1.03","rSquaredPrimary":"0.99","betaBroadBased":"0.69","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.85"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/3061","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"68.79","priceChangeAmount":"-0.21","priceChangePct":"-0.30","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"},"market":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"68.77","priceChangeAmount":"-0.23","priceChangePct":"-0.33","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-12T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"2.04","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":"BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"2.64","marketPrice":"2.58"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2018-09-04T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Total World Bond ETF     ","benchmarkShortName":"Bloomberg Glbl Agg Flt Adj Comp Idx               ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"3061","name":"Total World Bond ETF     ","calendarYTDPct":"-12.92","prevMonthPct":"-1.76","threeMonthPct":"0.90","oneYrPct":"-12.92","threeYrPct":"-3.24","sinceInceptionPct":"-0.12","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"marketPriceFundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"3061","name":"Total World Bond ETF     ","calendarYTDPct":"-12.91","prevMonthPct":"-1.71","threeMonthPct":"0.99","oneYrPct":"-12.91","threeYrPct":"-3.23","sinceInceptionPct":"-0.11","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"23366","name":"Bloomberg Glbl Agg Flt Adj Comp Idx               ","calendarYTDPct":"-12.88","prevMonthPct":"-1.44","threeMonthPct":"0.98","oneYrPct":"-12.88","threeYrPct":"-3.14","sinceInceptionPct":"-0.01","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"0920","ticker":"VIG","instrumentId":2155275,"shortName":"Dividend Apprec ETF","longName":"Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF","cusip":"921908844","IOVTicker":"VIG.IV","inceptionDate":"2006-04-21T00:00:00-04:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"VangdDivApp         ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"Domestic Stock -

The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund&#8217;s performance: <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk:</strong> the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8216;s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall market. In addition, the Fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk:</strong> the chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks may be more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li> <li><strong>ESG investing risk:</strong> which is the chance that the stocks selected for inclusion in the index by the index provider based on its disclosed ESG criteria generally will underperform the stock market as a whole or that the particular stocks selected by the index provider based on its ESG criteria will, in the aggregate, trail returns of other ESG funds. There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The index provider&#8217;s assessment of a company or of ESG criteria may differ from an investor&#8217;s assessment. As a result, stocks selected by the index provider for inclusion in the index may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The index provider is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data used to evaluate their ESG criteria. The ESG criteria assessed by the index provider may change over time. In addition, the fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

Performance could be hurt by:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk:</strong> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk:</strong> The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> To closely track the composition of the fund&#8217;s target index, more than 25% of the fund&#8217;s total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund&#8217;s total assets. In that case, the fund would be nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it would continue to hold approximately 300 stocks across a number of sectors. When the fund is operating as nondiversified, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund&#8217;s shares may experience more significant fluctuations in value than if the fund was diversified.</li> <li><strong>Sector risk:</strong> The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund&#8217;s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.

Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"S&P 500 Growth Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"1.00","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00","betaBroadBased":"1.03","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.91"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/3341","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"216.91","priceChangeAmount":"0.96","priceChangePct":"0.44","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"},"market":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"216.89","priceChangeAmount":"0.86","priceChangePct":"0.40","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"1.10","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":"BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"2.82","marketPrice":"2.80"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2010-09-07T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"S&P 500 Growth ETF       ","benchmarkShortName":"S&P 500 Growth Index                              ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"3341","name":"S&P 500 Growth ETF       ","calendarYTDPct":"-29.47","prevMonthPct":"-7.63","threeMonthPct":"1.43","oneYrPct":"-29.47","threeYrPct":"7.43","fiveYrPct":"10.15","tenYrPct":"13.44","sinceInceptionPct":"13.86","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"marketPriceFundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"3341","name":"S&P 500 Growth ETF       ","calendarYTDPct":"-29.48","prevMonthPct":"-7.58","threeMonthPct":"1.33","oneYrPct":"-29.48","threeYrPct":"7.44","fiveYrPct":"10.14","tenYrPct":"13.44","sinceInceptionPct":"13.86","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"29","name":"S&P 500 Growth Index                              ","calendarYTDPct":"-29.41","prevMonthPct":"-7.62","threeMonthPct":"1.45","oneYrPct":"-29.41","threeYrPct":"7.54","fiveYrPct":"10.28","tenYrPct":"13.59","sinceInceptionPct":"14.01","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"3340","ticker":"VOOV","instrumentId":6018244,"shortName":"S&P 500 Value ETF","longName":"Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF","cusip":"921932703","IOVTicker":"VOOV.IV","inceptionDate":"2010-09-07T00:00:00-04:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"Vangd500ValETF      ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"Domestic Stock -

The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund&#8217;s share price.

As a result, stocks selected by the index provider for inclusion in the index may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The index provider is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data used to evaluate their ESG criteria. The ESG criteria assessed by the index provider may change over time. In addition, the fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector. The index provider may evaluate security-level ESG data and, if applicable, ESG criteria that are relevant to the index only at index reviews or rebalances. Securities included in the index may cease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the index and the fund until a future review or rebalance by the index provider. As a result, certain securities in the index, or the index as a whole, may not meet the relevant ESG criteria at all times.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk:</strong> the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk:</strong> the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk:</strong> the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Index sampling risk:</strong> the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund&#8217;s target index.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"FTSE Global All Cap ex US Choice

Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by California and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in California than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall California municipal market.</li> <li><strong>Income risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund&#8217;s income is based on short-term interest rates&#8212;which can fluctuate significantly over short periods&#8212;income risk is expected to be high. A low or negative interest rate environment will adversely affect the fund&#8217;s return. Low or negative interest rates, depending on their duration and severity, could prevent the fund from, among other things, providing a positive yield and/or maintaining a stable share price of $1.</li> <li><strong>Credit risk</strong>, which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security, including restricted securities, in a timely manner at a desired price.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk</strong>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li> <li><strong>Tax risk</strong>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li> <li><strong>Structured products risk</strong>. The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li>

Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by New York and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in New York than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New York municipal market.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund&#8217;s income is based on short-term interest rates&#8212;which can fluctuate significantly over short periods&#8212;income risk is expected to be high.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be very low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.</LI><LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual funds.</LI><LI><strong>Tax risk: </strong>The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</LI><LI><strong>Derivatives risk: </strong>The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal bonds combined with a demand feature (i.e., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</LI></UL>"},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/0163","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"1.00","priceChangeAmount":"0.00","priceChangePct":"0.00","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"},"dailyMarketValue":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"1.0001","priceChangeAmount":"0.0000","priceChangePct":"0.00"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"2.39","compoundYieldPct":"2.42","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"C","footnoteText":"AVERAGE ANNUALIZED INCOME DIVIDEND OVER THE PAST 7 DAYS"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"0.10"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"1997-09-03T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"New York Muni Money Mkt  ","benchmarkShortName":"NY Tax-Exempt Money Mkt Funds Avg                 ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"0163","name":"New York Muni Money Mkt  ","calendarYTDPct":"1.02","prevMonthPct":"0.24","threeMonthPct":"0.58","oneYrPct":"1.02","threeYrPct":"0.50","fiveYrPct":"0.82","tenYrPct":"0.52","sinceInceptionPct":"1.34","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"194","name":"NY Tax-Exempt Money Mkt Funds Avg                 ","calendarYTDPct":"0.83","prevMonthPct":"0.22","threeMonthPct":"0.52","oneYrPct":"0.83","threeYrPct":"0.39","fiveYrPct":"0.61","tenYrPct":"0.35","sinceInceptionPct":"1.07","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"5132","ticker":"VBIRX","instrumentId":173644,"shortName":"Short-Term Bond Index Adm","longName":"Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund Admiral Shares","cusip":"921937702","inceptionDate":"2001-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"STBondAdml          ","style":"Bond Funds","type":"Short-Term Bond","category":"Short-Term Bond","customizedStyle":"Bond -

For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates.</li> <li><strong>Credit risk:</strong> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk:</strong> The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have more variable economic performance; greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk:</strong> The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk:</strong> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Currency hedging risk:</strong> The fund has the ability to invest in foreign bonds which may or may not be denominated in or hedged back to U.S. dollars. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposure. By entering into currency hedging transactions, the fund may eliminate any chance to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant currency exchange rates.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk:</strong> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> <li><strong>Derivatives risk:</strong> The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li> <li><strong>Counterparty risk:</strong> The chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"primaryBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg U.S. Universal Bond Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/V003","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"17.41","priceChangeAmount":"-0.05","priceChangePct":"-0.29","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-12T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"4.38","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"A","footnoteText":"BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY FOR PRIOR 30 DAYS;DISTRIBUTION MAY DIFFER"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"2.71"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Core-Plus Bond Admiral   ","benchmarkShortName":"Bloomberg US Universal Index                      ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"V003","name":"Core-Plus Bond Admiral   ","calendarYTDPct":"-12.59","prevMonthPct":"-0.29","threeMonthPct":"2.55","oneYrPct":"-12.59","sinceInceptionPct":"-10.51","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"11234","name":"Bloomberg US Universal Index                      ","calendarYTDPct":"-12.99","prevMonthPct":"-0.34","threeMonthPct":"2.24","oneYrPct":"-12.99","threeYrPct":"-2.54","fiveYrPct":"0.18","tenYrPct":"1.33","sinceInceptionPct":"-10.75","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"0036","ticker":"VFIIX","instrumentId":140324,"shortName":"GNMA Fund Investor Shares","longName":"Vanguard GNMA Fund Investor Shares","cusip":"922031307","inceptionDate":"1980-06-27T00:00:00-04:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"GNMA                ","style":"Bond Funds","type":"Intermediate-Term Bond","category":"Intermediate Government","customizedStyle":"Bond -

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Credit risk</strong>, which is the chance that a bond or loan issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond or loan to decline. Credit risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in junk bonds.</li> <li><strong>Call risk</strong>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be high for the fund because of the high percentage of callable bonds.</li> <li><strong>Income risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>","plainTalk":"An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Credit risk</strong>, which is the chance that a bond or loan issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond or loan to decline. Credit risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in junk bonds.</li> <li><strong>Call risk</strong>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be high for the fund because of the high percentage of callable bonds.</li> <li><strong>Income risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate to high for the fund, so investors should expect the fund&#8217;s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li> <li><strong>Interest rate risk</strong>, which is the chance that bond or loan prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:<UL><LI><strong>Country/regional risk: </strong>The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, periods &#160;of financial volatility, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</LI><LI><strong>Emerging markets risk: </strong>The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk is especially high for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Currency risk: </strong>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a significant percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in both investment-grade and below investment-grade bonds (also known as high-yield or junk bonds), credit risk should be high for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI><LI><strong>Derivatives risk: </strong>The chance that the use of derivatives&#8212;such as futures contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, swap agreements, and options&#8212;can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying security, asset, index, or reference rate. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying securities or assets. Also, a liquid market may not always exist for the fund&#8217;s derivative positions at times when the fund might wish to terminate or sell. The use of a derivative subjects the investor to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty (i.e., counterparty risk), potentially resulting in delayed or partial payment or even nonpayment of amounts due under the derivative contract.</LI><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund based on expected sensitivity of the portfolio to interest rate movements.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund&#8217;s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</LI><LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of low or falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:<UL><LI><strong>Country/regional risk: </strong>The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, periods &#160;of financial volatility, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</LI><LI><strong>Emerging markets risk: </strong>The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk is especially high for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Currency risk: </strong>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a significant percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers.</LI><LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in both investment-grade and below investment-grade bonds (also known as high-yield or junk bonds), credit risk should be high for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI><LI><strong>Derivatives risk: </strong>The chance that the use of derivatives&#8212;such as futures contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, swap agreements, and options&#8212;can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying security, asset, index, or reference rate. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying securities or assets. Also, a liquid market may not always exist for the fund&#8217;s derivative positions at times when the fund might wish to terminate or sell. The use of a derivative subjects the investor to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty (i.e., counterparty risk), potentially resulting in delayed or partial payment or even nonpayment of amounts due under the derivative contract.</LI><LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund based on expected sensitivity of the portfolio to interest rate movements.</LI><LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund&#8217;s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</LI><LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of low or falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund.</LI><LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global

subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than&#160;5 years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>","plainTalk":"The fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because stock and bond prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund&#8217;s bond and short-term investment holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund&#8217;s stock holdings. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk:</strong> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk:</strong> The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li> <li><strong>Interest rate risk:</strong> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.</li> <li><strong>Income risk:</strong> The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li> <li><strong>Credit risk:</strong> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li> <li><strong>Call risk:</strong> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk:</strong> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Wellington Composite Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market

account","initial":"3000","additional":"1"}},"risk":{"code":3,"level":"Moderate","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices. This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>","plainTalk":"The fund is subject to the risks associated with the U.S. and foreign stock and bond markets, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because fixed income securities such as bonds usually are less volatile than stocks and because the fund invests more than half of its assets in fixed income securities, the fund&#8217;s overall level of risk should be low to moderate.<br /> <ul> <li>With approximately 60% to 70% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign bonds the fund is proportionately subject to the following bond risks: interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates; income risk, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline; liquidity risk, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price; and call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign bonds: country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events &#8211; such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters &#8211; will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, or companies; currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates; and currency hedging risk, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposure.</li> <li>With approximately 30% to 40% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign equity securities, the fund is proportionately subject to the following stock risks: stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline; and investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization dividend-paying value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks because, among other things, mid-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign stocks. Country/regional risk is the chance that world events &#8211; such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters &#8211; will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Currency risk is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Country/regional risk and currency risk are especially high in emerging markets. The fund is also subject to manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.&#160;</li>

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>","plainTalk":"The fund is subject to the risks associated with the U.S. and foreign stock and bond markets, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because fixed income securities such as bonds usually are less volatile than stocks and because the fund invests more than half of its assets in fixed income securities, the fund&#8217;s overall level of risk should be low to moderate.<br /> <ul> <li>With approximately 60% to 70% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign bonds the fund is proportionately subject to the following bond risks: interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates; income risk, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline; liquidity risk, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price; and call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign bonds: country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events &#8211; such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters &#8211; will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, or companies; currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates; and currency hedging risk, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposure.</li> <li>With approximately 30% to 40% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign equity securities, the fund is proportionately subject to the following stock risks: stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline; and investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization dividend-paying value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks because, among other things, mid-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign stocks. Country/regional risk is the chance that world events &#8211; such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters &#8211; will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Currency risk is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Country/regional risk and currency risk are especially high in emerging markets. The fund is also subject to manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.&#160;</li>

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. In addition, the fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt disproportionately by a decline in the prices of just a few stocks. This is because, compared with other mutual funds, the fund invests a greater percentage of assets in the stocks of fewer companies. The fund&#8217;s performance could also be hurt by:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk:</strong> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk:</strong> The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li> <li><strong>Sector risk:</strong> The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund&#8217;s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> To closely track the composition of the fund&#8217;s target index, more than 25% of the fund&#8217;s total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund&#8217;s total assets.

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. In addition, the fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt disproportionately by a decline in the prices of just a few stocks. This is because, compared with other mutual funds, the fund invests a greater percentage of assets in the stocks of fewer companies. The fund&#8217;s performance could also be hurt by:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk:</strong> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk:</strong> The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li> <li><strong>Sector risk:</strong> The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund&#8217;s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> To closely track the composition of the fund&#8217;s target index, more than 25% of the fund&#8217;s total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund&#8217;s total assets. In that case, the fund would be nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it would continue to hold approximately 300 stocks across a number of sectors. When the fund is operating as nondiversified, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund&#8217;s shares may experience more significant fluctuations in value than if the fund was diversified.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Spliced Growth Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"1.00","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00","betaBroadBased":"1.06","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.90"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/0868","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"115.87","priceChangeAmount":"0.76","priceChangePct":"0.66","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"0.76","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":"BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"5.61"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"1998-05-14T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Growth Index Fund Inst   ","benchmarkShortName":"Spliced Growth Index                              ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"0868","name":"Growth Index Fund Inst   ","calendarYTDPct":"-33.14","prevMonthPct":"-8.46","threeMonthPct":"-0.15","oneYrPct":"-33.14","threeYrPct":"6.06","fiveYrPct":"9.62","tenYrPct":"12.81","sinceInceptionPct":"7.22","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"11434","name":"Spliced Growth Index                              ","calendarYTDPct":"-33.13","prevMonthPct":"-8.47","threeMonthPct":"-0.15","oneYrPct":"-33.13","threeYrPct":"6.09","fiveYrPct":"9.65","tenYrPct":"12.85","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"5023","ticker":"VHYAX","instrumentId":32101356,"shortName":"High Dividend Yld Idx Adm","longName":"Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund Admiral Shares","cusip":"921946786","inceptionDate":"2019-02-07T00:00:00-05:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"HiDvdYldAdml        ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"Domestic Stock -

The main risks of investing in the fund are:<UL><LI><strong>Stock market risk: </strong>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</LI><LI><strong>Investment style risk: </strong>The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</LI><LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>Due to a recent index rebalance and in order to closely track the composition of the fund&#8217;s target index, more than 25% of the fund&#8217;s total assets are invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund&#8217;s total assets. As a result, the fund is nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it continues to hold more than 100 stocks across a number of sectors. The fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund&#8217;s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</LI><LI><strong>Sector risk: </strong>The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund&#8217;s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</LI></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Spliced Mega Cap Growth Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"1.00","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00","betaBroadBased":"1.06","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.88"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/0838","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"361.04","priceChangeAmount":"2.44","priceChangePct":"0.68","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","yieldPct":"0.73","hasDisclaimer":false,"yieldNote":[{"footnoteCode":"B","footnoteText":"BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH"}]},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"5.61"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2008-04-03T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Mega Cap Grwth Ix Ist    ","benchmarkShortName":"Spliced Mega Cap Growth Index                     ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"0838","name":"Mega Cap Grwth Ix Ist    ","calendarYTDPct":"-33.55","prevMonthPct":"-8.84","threeMonthPct":"-1.01","oneYrPct":"-33.55","threeYrPct":"6.39","fiveYrPct":"9.98","tenYrPct":"13.23","sinceInceptionPct":"10.61","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"22530","name":"Spliced Mega Cap Growth Index                     ","calendarYTDPct":"-33.52","prevMonthPct":"-8.83","threeMonthPct":"-0.99","oneYrPct":"-33.52","threeYrPct":"6.44","fiveYrPct":"10.03","tenYrPct":"13.29","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"0828","ticker":"VMCTX","instrumentId":3385484,"shortName":"Mega Cap Index Ist","longName":"Vanguard Mega Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares","cusip":"921910857","inceptionDate":"2008-02-22T00:00:00-05:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"MegCapInt           ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"Domestic Stock -

Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The long-term investment approach of the fund may cause the fund to lose money or underperform compared to its benchmark index or other mutual funds over extended periods of time, and the fund may not perform as expected in the long term.

There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The advisor&#8217;s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds advised by the same or a different advisor or of an investor&#8217;s assessment of such company. As a result, stocks selected by the advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor. The advisor is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data being reported by companies to evaluate their ESG criteria.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance: <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk</strong>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>, which is the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Significant investments in Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.) subject the Index and the fund to proportionately higher exposure to Japanese and U.K. country risk.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li>

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by: <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk</strong>: the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>: the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets.

Any fund that concentrates in a particular industry will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. The precious metals and mining industry could be affected by sharp price volatility caused by global economic, financial, and political factors. Resource availability, government regulation, inflation expectations and economic cycles could also adversely affect that industry.&#160;</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock.

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance:<br /> <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk</strong>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing risk</strong>, which is the chance that the stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria generally will underperform the stock market as a whole or that the particular stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria will, in the aggregate, trail returns of other ESG funds. There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The advisor&#8217;s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds advised by the same or a different advisor or of an investor&#8217;s assessment of such company. As a result, stocks selected by the advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor. The advisor is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data being reported by companies to evaluate their ESG criteria. In addition, the advisor may not assess every investment for ESG factors and, when it does, not every ESG factor may be identified or evaluated. The ESG criteria assessed by the advisor may change over time.</li> <li><strong>Environmental-focused investing risk</strong>, which is the risk that the fund&#8217;s focus on environmental companies limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the fund and, as a result, the fund may underperform other funds that do not have such a focus. The fund&#8217;s environmental-focused investment strategy may result in the fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or forgoing opportunities to invest in securities that might otherwise be advantageous to buy. Additionally, if a particular security held by the fund no longer meets the environmental criteria subsequent to the time of investment, the fund may sell such investments at an inopportune time or at a time when those investments may be difficult to sell. In addition, the fund may incur expenses in an effort to dispose of such investments. The fund&#8217;s focus on securities of environmental companies means the fund will be more susceptible to events or factors affecting these companies, and the market prices of its portfolio securities may be more volatile than those of funds that are more diversified. Some environmental companies may have more limited operating histories and smaller market capitalizations on average than companies in other sectors. In addition, the fund is particularly susceptible to changes in global and regional climates, environmental protection regulatory actions, changes in government standards and subsidy levels, changes in taxation and other domestic and international and political, regulatory and economic developments.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>, which is the chance that returns from the types of growth stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The long-term investment approach of the fund may cause the fund to lose money or underperform compared to its benchmark index or other mutual funds over extended periods of time, and the fund may not perform as expected in the long term. An investment in the fund may be more suitable for long-term investors who can bear the risk of short- or medium-term fluctuations in the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>, which is the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest its assets in securities of companies located in emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>China risk and Hong Kong risk</strong>, which is the risk that investments in Chinese and Hong Kong issuers may subject the fund to risks associated those regions, including among others, more frequent trading suspensions and government intervention, currency exchange rate fluctuations or blockages, less liquidity, significantly higher price volatility and complexity in valuing portfolio holdings, limits on the use of brokers and on foreign ownership, different financial reporting standards, higher dependence on exports and international trade, potential for increased tariffs, sanctions, capital controls, embargoes and other trade limitations, custody risks, potential adverse tax consequences, and considerable degrees of social, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. The fund may also gain exposure to certain operating companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to the Chinese company through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs or the inability to enforce the contractual arrangements could significantly affect a VIE&#8217;s market value.</li> <li><strong>China A Shares risk and H shares</strong>, which are the risks of purchasing shares of companies located in China. The Fund may not be able to access its desired amount of A Shares. Investing in A shares through Stock Connect or the qualified foreign investor &#8221;QFI&#8221; program is subject to trading restrictions and suspensions, quota limitation and sudden changes in those limitations, and operational, clearing, and settlement risks. H Shares are subject to the risk that the Hong Kong stock market may behave differently than the mainland Chinese stock market and there may be little correlation between the performance of these two stock markets.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk</strong>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging and frontier markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few investments. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the instruments of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li> <li><strong>Asset concentration risk</strong>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li> <li><strong>Sector risk</strong>, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily flucuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than flucations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets are invested in the industrials, information technology, and utilities sectors, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of those sectors.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk</strong>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"primaryBenchmarkName":"MSCI All Country World Index Net","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"MSCI All Country World Index ex

The advisor&#8217;s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds advised by the same or a different advisor or of an investor&#8217;s assessment of such company. As a result, stocks selected by the advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor. The advisor is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data being reported by companies to evaluate their ESG criteria. In addition, the advisor may not assess every investment for ESG factors and, when it does, not every ESG factor may be identified or evaluated. The ESG criteria assessed by the advisor may change over time.</li> <li><strong>Environmental-focused investing risk</strong>, which is the risk that the fund&#8217;s focus on environmental companies limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the fund and, as a result, the fund may underperform other funds that do not have such a focus. The fund&#8217;s environmental-focused investment strategy may result in the fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or forgoing opportunities to invest in securities that might otherwise be advantageous to buy. Additionally, if a particular security held by the fund no longer meets the environmental criteria subsequent to the time of investment, the fund may sell such investments at an inopportune time or at a time when those investments may be difficult to sell. In addition, the fund may incur expenses in an effort to dispose of such investments. The fund&#8217;s focus on securities of environmental companies means the fund will be more susceptible to events or factors affecting these companies, and the market prices of its portfolio securities may be more volatile than those of funds that are more diversified. Some environmental companies may have more limited operating histories and smaller market capitalizations on average than companies in other sectors. In addition, the fund is particularly susceptible to changes in global and regional climates, environmental protection regulatory actions, changes in government standards and subsidy levels, changes in taxation and other domestic and international and political, regulatory and economic developments.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>, which is the chance that returns from the types of growth stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The long-term investment approach of the fund may cause the fund to lose money or underperform compared to its benchmark index or other mutual funds over extended periods of time, and the fund may not perform as expected in the long term. An investment in the fund may be more suitable for long-term investors who can bear the risk of short- or medium-term fluctuations in the value of the fund&#8217;s portfolio.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>, which is the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest its assets in securities of companies located in emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>China risk and Hong Kong risk</strong>, which is the risk that investments in Chinese and Hong Kong issuers may subject the fund to risks associated those regions, including among others, more frequent trading suspensions and government intervention, currency exchange rate fluctuations or blockages, less liquidity, significantly higher price volatility and complexity in valuing portfolio holdings, limits on the use of brokers and on foreign ownership, different financial reporting standards, higher dependence on exports and international trade, potential for increased tariffs, sanctions, capital controls, embargoes and other trade limitations, custody risks, potential adverse tax consequences, and considerable degrees of social, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. The fund may also gain exposure to certain operating companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to the Chinese company through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs or the inability to enforce the contractual arrangements could significantly affect a VIE&#8217;s market value.</li> <li><strong>China A Shares risk and H shares</strong>, which are the risks of purchasing shares of companies located in China. The Fund may not be able to access its desired amount of A Shares. Investing in A shares through Stock Connect or the qualified foreign investor &#8221;QFI&#8221; program is subject to trading restrictions and suspensions, quota limitation and sudden changes in those limitations, and operational, clearing, and settlement risks. H Shares are subject to the risk that the Hong Kong stock market may behave differently than the mainland Chinese stock market and there may be little correlation between the performance of these two stock markets.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk</strong>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging and frontier markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk</strong>, which is the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few investments. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the instruments of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li> <li><strong>Asset concentration risk</strong>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li> <li><strong>Sector risk</strong>, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily flucuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than flucations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets are invested in the industrials, information technology, and utilities sectors, the fund&#8217;s performance is impacted by the general condition of those sectors.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk</strong>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"primaryBenchmarkName":"MSCI All Country World Index Net","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"MSCI All Country World Index ex

Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>, which is the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Asset concentration risk</strong>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li> <li><strong>ESG investing risk</strong>, which is the chance that the stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria generally will underperform the stock market as a whole or that the particular stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria will, in the aggregate, trail returns of other ESG funds. There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The advisor&#8217;s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds or an investor&#8217;s assessment of such company. As a result, stocks selected by the advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor. The advisor is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data being reported by companies to evaluate their ESG criteria. The advisor&#8217;s ESG criteria may, at times, result in the fund becoming focused in the stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"FTSE All-World Index","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"MSCI All Country World Index ex USA","betaPrimary":"0.93","rSquaredPrimary":"0.93"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/0547","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"36.84","priceChangeAmount":"0.18","priceChangePct":"0.49","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"hasDisclaimer":false},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"6.32"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2019-06-05T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Global ESG Select Stk Adm","benchmarkShortName":"FTSE All-World Index                              ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"0547","name":"Global ESG Select Stk Adm","calendarYTDPct":"-10.74","prevMonthPct":"-2.34","threeMonthPct":"15.76","oneYrPct":"-10.74","threeYrPct":"9.25","sinceInceptionPct":"11.71","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"11859","name":"FTSE All-World Index                              ","calendarYTDPct":"-17.78","prevMonthPct":"-3.72","threeMonthPct":"10.03","oneYrPct":"-17.78","threeYrPct":"4.37","fiveYrPct":"5.56","tenYrPct":"8.39","sinceInceptionPct":"7.48","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"1758","ticker":"VGRLX","instrumentId":6186249,"shortName":"Gbl ex-US Real Est Ix Adm","longName":"Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares","cusip":"922042668","inceptionDate":"2011-02-10T00:00:00-05:00","newspaperAbbreviation":"GlobxUSREInxAdm     ","style":"Stock Funds","type":"International/Global Stock","category":"World Stock","customizedStyle":"International","secDesignation":"","maximumYearlyInvestment":"","expenseRatio":"0.1200","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2022-02-25T00:00:00-05:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":true,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":false,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true,"isPESite":false,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":false,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":true,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":false,"isBond":false,"isBalanced":false,"isStock":true,"isInternational":true,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":true,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":false,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":false,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":false,"isAdmiralShare":true,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":true,"isOpenToFlagship":false,"isOpenToFlagshipPlus":false,"isCitFund":false,"isAcctType15Fund":false,"isEtfOfEtfs":false,"isStandaloneEtf":false},"associatedFundIds":{"admiralFundId":"1758","etfFundId":"3358","institutionalFundId":"1858"},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"International","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":1,"name":"Stock Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":12,"name":"International/Global Stock"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":1208,"name":"World Stock"}},"largeTransactionAmount":500000,"qualifiedTransactionAmount":1000000,"minimumInitialInvestment":3000,"signalFundFlag":false},"minimum":{"general":{"name":"General Account","initial":"3000","additional":"1"},"ira":{"name":"IRA","additional":"1"},"ugma":{"name":"UGMA/UTMA","additional":"1"},"esa":{"name":"Education savings account","additional":"1"}},"risk":{"code":5,"level":"Aggressive","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices.

The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>","plainTalk":"An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund&#8217;s performance: <ul> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. growth stocks and, to the extent that the fund is invested in them, small- and mid-cap stocks, will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li> <li><strong>Stock market risk</strong>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>, which is the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk</strong>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the consumer discretionary sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk</strong>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li>

share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>","plainTalk":"An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<br /><strong><br />Stock market risk</strong>: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.<br /><strong>Country/Regional risk</strong>: The chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/Regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.<br /><strong>Currency risk</strong>: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.<br /><strong>Investment style risk</strong>: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks, to the extent that the fund invests in them, will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.<br /><strong>Emerging markets risk</strong>: The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.<UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Spliced Total International Stock

The fund&#8217;s annual income distributions are likely to fluctuate considerably. Under certain conditions, the fund may not have any income to distribute. Income fluctuations associated with changes in interest rates are expected to be low; however, income fluctuations associated with changes in inflation are expected to be high. Overall, investors can expect income fluctuations to be high for the fund. The fund is also subject to <em>interest rate risk, </em>which is the chance that the value of a bond will fluctuate because of a change in the level of interest rates. Although inflation-indexed bonds seek to provide inflation protection, their prices may decline when interest rates rise and vice versa.</li> <li><strong>Subsidiary investment risk:</strong> the fund is subject to risks associated with subsidiary investments<em>. </em>In particular, because the subsidiary is not organized as a mutual fund and is not registered under any federal or state securities laws (including the Investment Company Act of 1940), it does not offer the same investor protections available to shareholders of registered investment companies. In addition, the tax treatment of the fund&#8217;s investment in the subsidiary may be adversely affected by changes in the laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, of the United States and/or the jurisdiction of the subsidiary. The fund&#8217;s ownership of the subsidiary subjects it to the same risks as if it were invested directly in the assets owned by the subsidiary.</li> <li><strong>Leverage risk</strong><em>:</em> the chance that any leveraged losses will exceed the principal amount invested by the fund. Returns from a leveraged investment have the potential to be more volatile than returns from traditional stock and bond investments, which exposes the fund to heightened risks.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk: </strong>the chance that poor investment selection and/or poor strategy execution will cause the fund and/or the subsidiary to fail to achieve its investment objective or to generate lower returns than would be achieved from different investment selections. Poor investment selection by the advisor could also cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar investment objectives.</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the performance of relatively few investments. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"0.99","rSquaredPrimary":"0.98","betaBroadBased":"0.99","rSquaredBroadBased":"0.98"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/0517","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"27.23","priceChangeAmount":"0.11","priceChangePct":"0.41","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"hasDisclaimer":false},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"-0.40"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2019-06-25T00:00:00-04:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Commodity Strategy Adm   ","benchmarkShortName":"Bloomberg Commodity Index TR                      ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"0517","name":"Commodity Strategy Adm   ","calendarYTDPct":"13.96","prevMonthPct":"-1.97","threeMonthPct":"4.51","oneYrPct":"13.96","threeYrPct":"17.43","sinceInceptionPct":"15.65","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"23462","name":"Bloomberg Commodity Index TR                      ","calendarYTDPct":"16.09","prevMonthPct":"-2.45","threeMonthPct":"2.22","oneYrPct":"16.09","threeYrPct":"12.65","fiveYrPct":"6.44","tenYrPct":"-1.28","sinceInceptionPct":"11.41","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"4528","instrumentId":1439042,"shortName":"Vanguard Int Accum Port","longName":"Vanguard Interest Accumulation Portfolio","inceptionDate":"2004-10-15T00:00:00-04:00","style":"Money Market Funds","type":"Money Market","category":"Taxable Money Market","customizedStyle":"Money Market","secDesignation":"","maximumYearlyInvestment":"","expenseRatio":"0.1300","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2020-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":false,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":true,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isPESite":false,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":true,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":false,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":true,"isBond":false,"isBalanced":false,"isStock":false,"isInternational":false,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":false,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":false,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":true,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":false,"isAdmiralShare":false,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isOpenToFlagship":false,"isOpenToFlagshipPlus":false,"isCitFund":false,"isAcctType15Fund":false,"isEtfOfEtfs":false,"isStandaloneEtf":false},"associatedFundIds":{},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"Money Market","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":4,"name":"Money Market Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":41,"name":"Money Market"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":4101,"name":"Taxable Money Market"}},"largeTransactionAmount":999999999,"signalFundFlag":false},"minimum":{"general":{"initial":"3000"}},"risk":{"code":1,"level":"Conservative","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds are classified as conservative if their share prices are expected to remain stable or to fluctuate only slightly.

The underlying funds will not use derivatives for speculation or for the purpose of leveraging (magnifying) investment returns.</li> <li><strong>Index sampling risk:</strong> The chance that the securities selected for an underlying fund that uses the sampling method of indexing will not, in the aggregate, provide investment performance matching that of the index.</li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Vanguard 529 Income Composite","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index","betaPrimary":"1.01","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/4513","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"17.07","priceChangeAmount":"-0.04","priceChangePct":"-0.23","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"hasDisclaimer":false},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"1.55"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2002-12-16T00:00:00-05:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Vanguard Income          ","benchmarkShortName":"Vanguard 529 Income Composite                     ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"4513","name":"Vanguard Income          ","calendarYTDPct":"-7.84","prevMonthPct":"-0.88","threeMonthPct":"0.90","oneYrPct":"-7.84","threeYrPct":"-1.09","fiveYrPct":"0.78","tenYrPct":"0.85","sinceInceptionPct":"2.63","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"id":"11391","name":"Vanguard 529 Income Composite                     ","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"4522","instrumentId":520223,"shortName":"Vanguard Ttl Bond Mkt Idx","longName":"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Portfolio","inceptionDate":"2002-12-16T00:00:00-05:00","style":"Bond Funds","type":"Intermediate-Term Bond","category":"Intermediate-Term Bond","customizedStyle":"Bond - Inter-term Investment","fixedIncomeInvestmentStyleId":"2","fixedIncomeInvestmentStyleName":"Intermediate-term Treasury","secDesignation":"","maximumYearlyInvestment":"","expenseRatio":"0.1400","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2020-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":false,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":true,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isPESite":false,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":true,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":true,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":false,"isBond":true,"isBalanced":false,"isStock":false,"isInternational":false,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":false,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":false,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":true,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":true,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":false,"isAdmiralShare":false,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isOpenToFlagship":false,"isOpenToFlagshipPlus":false,"isCitFund":false,"isAcctType15Fund":false,"isEtfOfEtfs":false,"isStandaloneEtf":false},"associatedFundIds":{},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"Bond - Inter-term Investment","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":3,"name":"Bond Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":31,"name":"Intermediate-Term Bond"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":3105,"name":"Intermediate-Term Bond"}},"largeTransactionAmount":99999999999,"signalFundFlag":false},"minimum":{"general":{"initial":"3000"}},"risk":{"code":2,"level":"Conservative to Moderate","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as conservative to moderate are subject to low-to-moderate fluctuations in share prices.

An underlying fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the underlying fund&#8217;s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the underlying fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate.</li> <li><strong>Prepayment risk.</strong> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by an underlying fund. The&#160;underlying fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage&#8217;s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the Underlying Fund&#8217;s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the underlying fund&#8217;s portfolio turnover rate.</li> <li><strong>Extension risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. For underlying funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will prepay their mortgages at slower rates.</li> <li><strong>Stock market risk.</strong> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. An&#160;underlying fund&#8217;s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Underlying Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.

The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Country/Regional risk: </strong><strong>T</strong>he chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value or liquidity of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Currency Risk: </strong>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li> <li><strong>Emerging markets risk: </strong>The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li> <li><strong>Derivatives risk.</strong> Each of the underlying funds may invest, to a limited extent, in derivatives. Generally speaking, a derivative if a financial contract whose value is based on the value of a financial asset (such as a stock, bond, or currency), a physical asset (such as gold, oil, or wheat), a market index (such as the S&#38;P 500 Index), or a reference rate (such as LIBOR).

For underlying funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will prepay their mortgages at slower rates. </li> <li><strong>Currency hedging risk: </strong>The chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by an underlying fund may not perfectly offset the&#160;underlying fund&#8217;s foreign currency exposures. </li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that an&#160;underlying fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few or even a single issuer. Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a significant percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers. </li> <li><strong>Index sampling risk:</strong> The chance that the securities selected for an&#160;underlying funds that uses the sampling method of indexing will not, in the aggregate, provide investment performance matching that of the index. </li> <li><strong>Derivatives risk: </strong>Each of the underlying funds may invest, to a limited extent, in derivatives. Generally speaking, a derivative if a financial contract whose value is based on the value of a financial asset (such as a stock, bond, or currency), a physical asset (such as gold, oil, or wheat), a market index (such as the S&#38;P 500 Index), or a reference rate (such as LIBOR). Investments in derivatives may subject the underlying funds to risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets. The underlying funds will not use derivatives for speculation or for the purpose of leveraging (magnifying) investment returns. </li> </ul><UL></UL>","volatility":{"asOfDate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","primaryBenchmarkName":"Vanguard 529 Moderate Growth Composite","broadBasedBenchmarkName":"Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index","betaPrimary":"1.02","rSquaredPrimary":"1.00"}},"fees":{"purchaseFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"PURCHASE_FEE"},"redemptionFee":{"content":"None","FeeType":"REDEMPTION_FEE"}},"link":{"type":"application/xml,application/json","href":"http://api.vanguard.com/rs/ire/01/ind/etf,mf,plan529/month-end/4511","ref":"self"},"dailyPrice":{"regular":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","price":"32.15","priceChangeAmount":"0.03","priceChangePct":"0.09","currOrPrmlFlag":"CURR","currOrPrmlValue":"Price"}},"yield":{"hasDisclaimer":false},"ytd":{"asOfDate":"2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00","regular":"4.11"},"monthEndAvgAnnualRtn":{"sinceInceptionAsOfDate":"2002-12-11T00:00:00-05:00","asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","shortName":"Vanguard Moderate Growth ","benchmarkShortName":"Vanguard 529 Mod Growth Composite                 ","fundReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"4511","name":"Vanguard Moderate Growth ","calendarYTDPct":"-15.21","prevMonthPct":"-2.86","threeMonthPct":"5.61","oneYrPct":"-15.21","threeYrPct":"0.87","fiveYrPct":"3.01","tenYrPct":"5.18","sinceInceptionPct":"5.78","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":false},"benchmarkReturn":{"asOfDate":"2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00","id":"11389","name":"Vanguard 529 Mod Growth Composite                 ","calendarYTDPct":"-14.96","prevMonthPct":"-2.39","threeMonthPct":"5.70","oneYrPct":"-14.96","threeYrPct":"1.47","fiveYrPct":"3.42","tenYrPct":"5.51","isLastMonthEndPerformanceDataAvailable":true}}},{"type":"priceMonthEndPerformance","profile":{"fundId":"4543","instrumentId":2612697,"shortName":"Vanguard STAR Portfolio","longName":"Vanguard STAR Portfolio","inceptionDate":"2006-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","style":"Balanced Funds","type":"Balanced","category":"Moderate Allocation","customizedStyle":"Balanced","equityInvestmentStyleId":"2","equityInvestmentStyleName":"Large-cap blend","fixedIncomeInvestmentStyleId":"5","fixedIncomeInvestmentStyleName":"Intermediate-term investment-grade","secDesignation":"","maximumYearlyInvestment":"","expenseRatio":"0.4200","expenseRatioAsOfDate":"2020-10-30T00:00:00-04:00","isInternalFund":true,"isExternalFund":false,"isMutualFund":false,"isETF":false,"isVLIP":false,"isVVAP":false,"is529":true,"hasAssociatedInvestorFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isPESite":false,"fundFact":{"isActiveFund":true,"isClosed":false,"isClosedToNewInvestors":false,"isFundOfFunds":true,"isMSCIIndexedFund":false,"isIndex":false,"isLoadFund":false,"isMoneyMarket":false,"isBond":false,"isBalanced":true,"isStock":false,"isInternational":false,"isMarketNeutralFund":false,"isInternationalStockFund":false,"isInternationalBalancedFund":false,"isDomesticStockFund":false,"isTaxable":true,"isTaxExempt":false,"isTaxManaged":false,"isTaxableBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptBondFund":false,"isTaxExemptMoneyMarketFund":false,"isTaxSensitiveFund":true,"isSpecialtyStockFund":false,"isHybridFund":false,"isGlobal":false,"isManagedPayoutFund":false,"isGNMAFund":false,"isInvestorShare":false,"isAdmiralShare":false,"isInstitutionalShare":false,"isAdmiralFund":false,"isStableValueFund":false,"isCompanyStockFund":false,"isREITFund":false,"isVariableInsuranceFund":false,"isComingledTrustFund":false,"isConvertibleFund":false,"isAssetAllocationFund":false,"isStateMunicipalBond":false,"isNationalMunicipalBond":false,"isQualifiedOnly":false,"isPreciousMetalsFund":false,"mIsVIPSFund":false,"isSectorSpecific":false,"hasOtherIndex":false,"isTargetRetirementFund":false,"isRetirementSavingsTrustFund":false,"isNon40ActFund":false,"isUnfundedFund":false,"isCreditSuisseFund":false,"isKaiserFund":false,"isFundAccessFund":false,"isFundTransferableToVGI":false,"hasTransactionFee":false,"isNTFFund":false,"hasMoreThan1ShareClass":false,"isOpenToFlagship":false,"isOpenToFlagshipPlus":false,"isCitFund":false,"isAcctType15Fund":false,"isEtfOfEtfs":false,"isStandaloneEtf":false},"associatedFundIds":{},"fundCategory":{"customizedHighCategoryName":"Balanced","high":{"type":"HIGH","id":2,"name":"Balanced Funds"},"mid":{"type":"MID","id":21,"name":"Balanced"},"low":{"type":"LOW","id":2103,"name":"Moderate Allocation"}},"largeTransactionAmount":999999999,"signalFundFlag":false},"minimum":{"general":{"initial":"3000"}},"risk":{"code":3,"level":"Moderate","levelDesc":"<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices.
